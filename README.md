## Bugs and Fixes

### Navigation Bar on Small Screens

#### Issue:
In the earlier stages of development, I encountered a challenge related to the navigation bar's responsiveness, particularly on smaller screens. The collapsible menu was not functioning correctly, leading to accessibility issues and an inconsistent user experience.

#### Troubleshooting Steps
I followed a systematic approach to identify and resolve the issue:

1. **Code Review:** Carefully reviewed the HTML and CSS related to the navigation bar, checking for any syntax errors or misconfigurations.
2. **Bootstrap Documentation:** Consulted the Bootstrap documentation specifically related to the navbar and collapsible behavior to ensure alignment with best practices.
3. **Browser DevTools:** Utilized browser developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS, identifying any unexpected behavior or conflicts.


#### Solution:
Adjusted the Bootstrap navigation bar breakpoint and added custom CSS to ensure a responsive and user-friendly navigation experience on smaller devices.

```html
<!-- Updated Bootstrap Navbar -->
 <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark fixed-top" >
      <a class="navbar-brand"  href="index.html">
      <img src="assets/images/logo.png" alt="Logo"  style="margin-left: 15px; height:50px"/>
      </a>

      <button
        class="navbar-toggler"
        type="button"
        data-bs-toggle="collapse"
        data-bs-target="#navbarNav"
        aria-controls="navbarNav"
        aria-expanded="false"
        aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
      </button>

  <!-- Navbar content -->
  <!-- ... -->
</nav>
```

```css
.fixed-top {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    z-index: 1000;
}

```

### Responsive Cards in "Why Yemeni Crown" & "Our Team" Sections

#### Issue:
While working on the "Why Yemeni Crown" and "Our Team" sections, I observed that the cards were not responsive enough. On smaller screens, the content was either getting cut off or not displaying correctly, affecting the overall visual appeal and user experience.

#### Solution:
Implemented adjustments to the card styles and structure to enhance responsiveness on smaller screens. Utilized Bootstrap utility classes and custom CSS to ensure optimal display across a range of devices.

```css
/* Responsive Styles */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .about-section2 .col-md-4 {
        margin-bottom: 10px;}
}

@media (max-width: 992px) {

    .about-section2 .card {
        padding: 20px;
        max-width: 600px;
        margin: 20px auto;
    }

    .about-section2 h4 {
        font-size: 1.2em;
    }

    .about-section2 p {
        font-size: 0.8em;
    }
}
```
